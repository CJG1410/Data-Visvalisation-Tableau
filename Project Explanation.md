## Introduction

Solid waste management is a critical issue in India due to its rapidly growing population and urbanization. Effective waste management is essential to maintain public health, environmental sustainability, and the overall quality of life. This project aims to visualize and analyze data related to solid waste management in Indian states and union territories, providing valuable insights into the current state of affairs.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project is collected from various official sources, including government reports, environmental agencies, and research organizations. It includes information on waste generation, waste collection, recycling rates, landfill usage, and more. The data is aggregated and cleaned to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Data Preprocessing

Before creating the Tableau dashboards, the data underwent a series of preprocessing steps to ensure it was suitable for visualization. This included data cleaning, transformation, and integration of multiple datasets. The cleaned and processed data is available in the `data` directory of this repository.

## Tableau Dashboards

The core of this project is a set of interactive Tableau dashboards that allow users to explore various aspects of solid waste management in Indian states and union territories. These dashboards provide visualizations, charts, and filters that make it easy to gain insights from the data.

### List of Dashboards

1. **Waste Generation Overview**: Visualizes the total waste generated by each state/union territory and its distribution by type (e.g., municipal solid waste, industrial waste).

2. **Waste Collection Analysis**: Analyzes the efficiency of waste collection services, including collection rates, frequency, and coverage.

3. **Recycling Rates and Practices**: Examines recycling rates and practices, highlighting states with successful recycling programs.

4. **Landfill Usage and Capacity**: Provides insights into landfill usage, capacity, and the percentage of waste sent to landfills.

5. **Waste Management Policies**: Explores the impact of waste management policies and regulations on waste management practices.

## Usage

To use the Tableau dashboards, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
3. Connect to the relevant data source (provided in the repository's `data` directory).
4. Import the Tableau workbooks (`.twb` files) from the `dashboards` directory.
5. Explore and interact with the dashboards to gain insights into solid waste management in Indian states and union territories.
